# Gemchan
Gemchan is a textboard for Gemini! This repo is a little messy because I was in a hurry when I first made it for some reason, and my deployment consists of running a `git pull` on the server. I'll get around to cleaning it up eventually.

Feel free to clone this and run it on your own server. You'll have to generate new certificates and keys, but it's not hard. To access the real Gemchan, just visit gemini://gemchan.space in your favorite Gemini client!
